    <h1>Algebric Alogorithms</h1>
    <blockquote>Algebra is one of the definitive and oldest branches of mathematics,
       and design of computer algorithms is one of the youngest. Despite this generation gap, 
       the two disciplines beautifully interweave. Firstly, modern computers would be somewhat useless
        if they were not able to carry out arithmetic and algebraic computations
       efficiently, so we need to think on dedicated, sometimes rather sophisticated algorithms for these operations. </blockquote>
